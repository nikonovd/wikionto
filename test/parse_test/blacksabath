'''Black Sabbath''' were an English [[rock music|rock]]<!-- HEAVY METAL is in the infobox, per previous consensus. Do not change "Rock" without an agreement on talk page, whatever your point of view --> band, formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1968,<!--See reference below: they were formed in 1968, as they took Black Sabbath name instead of Earth, so DO NOT change here--> by guitarist and main songwriter [[Tony Iommi]], bassist and main lyricist [[Geezer Butler]], drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] and singer [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of [[heavy metal music]].<ref name="Larson2004a"/> The band helped define the genre with releases such as ''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'' (1970), ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (1970) and ''[[Master of Reality]]'' (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history.

Formed in 1968 as the Polka Tulk Blues Band, a blues rock band, the group went through line up changes, renamed themselves as Earth, broke up and reformed. By 1969, they had named themselves Black Sabbath after the film ''[[Black Sabbath (film)|Black Sabbath]]'' starring [[Boris Karloff]], and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. The band's first show as Black Sabbath took place on 30 August 1969, in [[Workington]]. Signing to [[Philips Records]] in November 1969, they released their first single, "[[Evil Woman (Crow song)|Evil Woman]]" in January 1970. Their debut album, ''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'', was released on [[Friday the 13th]], February 1970, on Philips' newly formed progressive rock label, [[Vertigo Records]]. Though receiving a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success and reached number 8 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], so the band returned to the studios to quickly record the follow up, ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'', which was also released in 1970. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's ''[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]'', critics were starting to respond favourably.

Osbourne's regular use of alcohol and other drugs led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]]. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured many personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists [[Ian Gillan]], [[Glenn Hughes]], [[Ray Gillen]] and [[Tony Martin (British singer)|Tony Martin]], as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1991, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer [[Vinny Appice]] to record ''[[Dehumanizer]]'' (1992). The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album ''[[Reunion (Black Sabbath album)|Reunion]]''. Black Sabbath's final studio album and nineteenth overall, ''[[13 (Black Sabbath album)|13]]'' (2013), features all of the original members but Ward, who left the band prior to the recording sessions due to a contract dispute. A year after embarking on a [[The End Tour|farewell tour]], the band played their final concert in their home city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017,<ref name="finalshow">{{cite web|author1=BBC News|authorlink1=BBC News|title=Black Sabbath bow out in Birmingham after final concert|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38871686|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 February 2017|date=5 February 2017}}</ref> after which they broke up.<ref name="nme">{{cite web|last1=Trendell|first1=Andrew|title=Black Sabbath confirm their split after nearly 50 years|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/black-sabbath-confirm-their-split-after-nearly-50-years-2006633|website=[[NME]]|date=8 March 2017|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref> Iommi has stated that he has not ruled out the possibility of new material or one-off shows under the Black Sabbath name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tony Iommi: Black Sabbath Hasn't Ruled Anything Out Apart From Large-Scale Touring|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/tony-iommi-black-sabbath-hasnt-ruled-anything-out-apart-from-large-scale-touring/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref>

They were ranked by [[MTV]] as the "Greatest Metal Band" of all time, and placed second in [[VH1]]'s "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock" list. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them number 85 in their "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005 and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2006. They have also won two [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]].

== History ==

=== Formation and early days (1968–1969) ===
Following the break-up of their previous band [[Mythology (British band)|Mythology]] in 1968, guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] and drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] sought to form a heavy blues rock band in [[Aston]], Birmingham. They enlisted bassist [[Geezer Butler]] and vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]], who had played together in a band called Rare Breed, Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop: "Ozzy Zig Needs Gig – has own PA".<ref>{{cite episode |title="Heavy Metal" |episodelink= |series= Seven Ages of Rock|serieslink= |credits= |network= |station= [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]] |airdate= 5 March 2009|minutes= 8}}</ref> The new group was initially named the Polka Tulk Blues Band, the name taken either from a brand of talcum powder{{sfn|Osbourne|Ayres|2010|p=63}} or an Indian/Pakistani clothing shop; the exact origin is confused.<ref>McIver 2006, p. 35.</ref> The Polka Tulk Blues Band included slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips, a childhood friend of Osbourne's, and saxophonist Alan "Aker" Clarke. After shortening the name to Polka Tulk, the band again changed their name to Earth (which Osbourne hated){{sfn|Osbourne|Ayres|2010|p=84}} and continued as a four-piece without Phillips and Clarke.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dwyer |first=Robert |url=http://www.sabbathlive.com/timelines.html |title=Timelines |publisher=Sabbathlive.com |accessdate=9 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120194400/http://www.sabbathlive.com/timelines.html |archivedate=20 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name="Black Sabbath member history">{{cite web|last=Siegler|first=Joe|url=http://www.black-sabbath.com/theband/timeline/|title=Black Sabbath Online: Band Lineup History|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref> Iommi became concerned that Phillips and Clarke lacked the necessary dedication and were not taking the band seriously. Rather than asking them to leave, they instead decided to break up and then quietly reformed the band as a four-piece.<ref name="iommiautobiography">{{cite book |last=Iommi |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Iommi |title=Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath |year=2011 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-81955-1}}</ref> While the band was performing under the Earth title, they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as "The Rebel", "Song for Jim", and "When I Came Down".<ref name="Guitar World">{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Chris|title=The Eternal Idol|magazine=Guitar World|date=December 2008}}</ref> The demo titled "Song for Jim" was in reference to Jim Simpson.

In December 1968, Iommi abruptly left Earth to join [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Melody Maker 21 December 1968 |url=http://www.sabbathlive.com/sabtours/earth/mm211268 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604013639/http://www.sabbathlive.com/sabtours/earth/mm211268 |archivedate=4 June 2007 |work=[[Melody Maker]] Magazine |accessdate=14 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> Although his stint with the band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. "It just wasn't right, so I left", Iommi said. "At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having a leader in the band, which was [[Ian Anderson]]'s way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=34}}

While playing shows in England in 1969, the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth. They decided to change their name again. A cinema across the street from the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 horror film ''[[Black Sabbath (film)|Black Sabbath]]'' starring [[Boris Karloff]] and directed by [[Mario Bava]]. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was "strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2002/ozzy_int.asp |title=Ozzy Osbourne: The Godfather of Metal |publisher=NYRock.com |accessdate=14 February 2008 |date=June 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031000904/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2002/ozzy_int.asp |archivedate=31 October 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called "[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer [[Dennis Wheatley]],{{sfn|Strong|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Wilson|2004|p=51}} along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed.<ref>''Ozzy Osbourne: Behind the Music'' by [[VH1]]; first aired 19 April 1998.</ref> Making use of the musical [[tritone]], also known as "the Devil's Interval",{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=72}} the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction,<ref name="Black Sabbath's song review">{{cite web|last=Torreano|first=Bradley|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/black-sabbath-mt0030286828|title=Black Sabbath – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Koskoff|2005|p=356}} a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by [[flower power]], [[folk music]], and [[hippie|hippie culture]].

=== ''Black Sabbath'' and ''Paranoid'' (1970–1971) ===
The band's first show as Black Sabbath took place on 30 August 1969, in [[Workington]].<ref name="iommiautobiography" /> They were signed to [[Philips Records]] in November 1969,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/black-sabbath/bio/ |title=Black Sabbath Biography &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> and released their first single, "[[Evil Woman (Crow song)|Evil Woman]]" (a cover of a song by the band [[Crow (band)|Crow]]), recorded at [[Trident Studios]], through Philips subsidiary [[Fontana Records]] in January 1970. Later releases were handled by Philips' newly formed progressive rock label, [[Vertigo Records]].

Black Sabbath's first major exposure came when the band appeared on [[John Peel]]'s ''Top Gear'' radio show in 1969, performing "[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]", "[[N.I.B.]]", "Behind the Wall of Sleep", and "Sleeping Village" to a national audience in Great Britain shortly before recording of their first album commenced.<ref name="iommiautobiography" /> Although the "Evil Woman" single failed to chart, the band were afforded two days of studio time in November to record their debut album with producer [[Rodger Bain]]. Iommi recalls recording live: "We thought 'We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=38}}

''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'' was released on [[Friday the 13th]], February 1970, and reached number 8 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Following its U.S. and Canadian release in May 1970 by [[Warner Bros. Records]], the album reached number 23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], where it remained for over a year.<ref name="billboard_200">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/black-sabbath-mn0000771438/awards|title=Black Sabbath – Awards|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="rollingstonebiography">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/black-sabbath/biography|title=Black Sabbath – Biography|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> The album was a commercial success but was widely panned by some critics. [[Lester Bangs]] dismissed it in a ''Rolling Stone'' review as "discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like velocitised speedfreaks all over each other's musical perimeters, yet never quite finding synch".<ref>{{cite web|last=Bangs|first=Lester|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/black-sabbath-19700917|title=Black Sabbath – Album Review|work=Rolling Stone|date=17 September 1970|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> It sold in substantial numbers despite being panned, giving the band their first mainstream exposure.<ref>Black Sabbath album, inside book details, re-release, compact disc version</ref> It has since been [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] in both U.S. by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and in the United Kingdom by [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).<ref name="riaa"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |title=Certified Awards |publisher=British Phonographic Industry (BPI) |accessdate=8 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315204844/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |archivedate=15 March 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>

To capitalise on their chart success in the U.S., the band returned to the studio in June 1970, just four months after ''Black Sabbath'' was released. The new album was initially set to be named ''War Pigs'' after the song "[[War Pigs]]", which was critical of the [[Vietnam War]]; however, Warner changed the title of the album to ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]''. The album's lead-off single, "[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]", was written in the studio at the last minute. Ward explains: "We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the [Paranoid] guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=57}} The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit.<ref name="rollingstonebiography"/> The album followed in the UK in October 1970, where, pushed by the success of the "Paranoid" single, it made number one in the charts.

The U.S. release was held off until January 1971, as the ''Black Sabbath'' album was still on the charts at the time of ''Paranoid''{{'}}s UK release. Black Sabbath subsequently toured the [[United States]] for the first time and played their first U.S. show at a club called Ungano's at 210 West 70th Street in New York City.<ref name="osbourneautobiography">{{cite book |last=Osbourne |first=Ozzy |authorlink=Ozzy Osbourne |title=I Am Ozzy |year=2011 |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |isbn=978-0-446-56990-3}}</ref> The album reached No. 12 in the U.S. in March 1971,<ref name="billboard_200"/> and would go on to sell four million copies in the U.S.,<ref name="riaa"/> with virtually no radio airplay.<ref name="rollingstonebiography"/> Like ''Black Sabbath'', the album was panned by rock critics of the era, but modern-day reviewers such as AllMusic's Steve Huey cite ''Paranoid'' as "one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time", which "defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history".<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/paranoid-mw0000600570|title=Paranoid – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The album was ranked at No. 131 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/black-sabbath-paranoid-20120524|title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: (131) Black Sabbath – Paranoid|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> ''Paranoid''{{'}}s chart success allowed the band to tour the U.S. for the first time in October 1970, which spawned the release of the album's second single "[[Iron Man (song)|Iron Man]]". Although the single failed to reach the top 40, "Iron Man" remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs, as well as the band's highest charting U.S. single until 1998's "[[Psycho Man (Black Sabbath song)|Psycho Man]]".<ref name="billboard_200"/>

=== ''Master of Reality'' and ''Volume 4'' (1971–1973) ===

Following the chart success of ''Paranoid'', the band were afforded more studio time, along with a "briefcase full of cash" to buy drugs.{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=63}} "We were getting into coke, big time", Ward explained. "Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like. It got to the stage where you come up with ideas and forget them, because you were just so out of it."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=52}}

Production completed in April 1971, in July the band released ''[[Master of Reality]]'', just six months after the U.S. release of ''Paranoid''. The album reached the top ten in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, and was certified gold in less than two months,<ref name="riaa"/> eventually receiving platinum certification in the 1980s and Double Platinum in the early 21st century.<ref name="riaa"/> It contained Sabbath's first [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs, alongside fan favourites such as "[[Children of the Grave]]" and "[[Sweet Leaf]]".<ref name="Master of Reality AMG Review">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/master-of-reality-mw0000189231|title=Master of Reality – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Critical response of the era was generally unfavourable, with [[Lester Bangs]] delivering an ambivalent review of ''Master of Reality'' in ''Rolling Stone'', describing the closing "Children of the Grave" as "naïve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel – but in the tradition [of rock'n'roll]... The only criterion is excitement, and Black Sabbath's got it".<ref name="Master of Reality Album Rebiew">{{cite web|last=Bangs|first=Lester|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/master-of-reality-19711125|title=Master of Reality Rolling Stone Review|date=25 November 1971|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> (In 2003, ''Rolling Stone'' would place the album at number 300 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/black-sabbath-master-of-reality-20120524|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: (300) Black Sabbath – Master of Reality|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>)

Following the ''Master of Reality'' world tour in 1972, Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: "The band started to become very fatigued and very tired. We'd been on the road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think ''Master of Reality'' was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=64–65}}

In June 1972, the band reconvened in Los Angeles to begin work on their next album at the [[Record Plant]]. Recording was plagued with problems, many as a result of substance abuse issues. Struggling to record the song "Cornucopia" after "sitting in the middle of the room, just doing drugs",{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=73}} Ward was nearly fired. "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible," the drummer said. "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=73–74}} The album was originally titled ''Snowblind'' after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to ''[[Black Sabbath Vol. 4]]''. Ward observed, "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=65}}

''Vol. 4'' was released in September 1972 and, while critics were dismissive, it achieved gold status in less than a month, and was the band's fourth consecutive release to sell a million in the U.S.<ref name="riaa"/> With more time in the studio, the album saw the band experimenting with new textures, such as strings, piano, orchestration and multi-part songs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/black-sabbath-vol-4-mw0000199950|title=Vol. 4 – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> "Tomorrow's Dream" was released as a single – the band's first since "Paranoid" – but failed to chart.<ref name="billboard_200"/>

Following an extensive tour of the U.S., in 1973 the band travelled again to Australia, followed by a tour for the first time to New Zealand, before moving onto mainland Europe. "The band were definitely in their heyday," recalled Ward, "in the sense that nobody had burnt out quite yet."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Ron|last=Schroer|title=Bill Ward & The Hand Of Doom – Part IV: Living Naked|magazine=Southern Cross ''(Sabbath [[fanzine]])'' #21|date=May 1998|p=68}}</ref>

=== ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' and ''Sabotage'' (1973–1976) ===
Following the ''Volume 4'' world tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles to begin work on their next release. Pleased with the ''Volume 4'' album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on ''Volume 4'' and we really got discontent" Iommi said. "Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=76}}

After a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to England. They rented [[Clearwell Castle]] in [[Forest of Dean|The Forest of Dean]]. "We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things, and stuff started coming out again."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=77}} While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of "[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (song)|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]", which set the tone for the new material. Recorded at [[Morgan Studios]] in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on ''Volume 4'', new songs incorporated synthesisers, strings, and complex arrangements. [[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] was brought in as a session player, appearing on "[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath|Sabbra Cadabra]]".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=79}}

In November 1973, Black Sabbath began to receive positive reviews in the mainstream press after the release of ''[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]'', with Gordon Fletcher of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calling the album "an extraordinarily gripping affair", and "nothing less than a complete success."<ref>{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Gordon|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/sabbath-bloody-sabbath-19740213|title=Sabbath Bloody Sabbath – Album Review|work=Rolling Stone|date=13 February 1974|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> Later reviewers such as AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as a "masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection", while also displaying "a newfound sense of finesse and maturity."<ref name="SBS AMG Review">{{cite web|last=Eduardo|first=Rivadavia|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sabbath-bloody-sabbath-mw0000194838|title=Sabbath Bloody Sabbath – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the U.S.,<ref name="riaa"/> reaching number four on the United Kingdom charts, and number eleven in the U.S.

The band began a world tour in January 1974, which culminated at the [[California Jam]] festival in [[Ontario, California]], on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 200,000 fans, Black Sabbath appeared alongside popular 1970s rock and pop bands [[Deep Purple]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]], [[Seals and Crofts|Seals & Crofts]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], and [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the U.S., exposing the band to a wider American audience. In the same year, the band shifted management, signing with notorious English manager [[Don Arden]]. The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath's former management, and while on stage in the U.S., Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation.{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=76}}

Black Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at [[Morgan Studios]] in [[Willesden]], this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from ''Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath''. "We could've continued and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album – ''Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath'' wasn't a rock album, really."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=80}} Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, ''[[Sabotage (Black Sabbath album)|Sabotage]]'' was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with ''Rolling Stone'' stating "''Sabotage'' is not only Black Sabbath's best record since ''Paranoid'', it might be their best ever",<ref>{{cite web|date=September 1975 |last=Altman |first=Billy |title=''Sabotage'' Album Review |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/170807/review/5946986/sabotage |work=Rolling Stone Magazine No. 196, 25 September 1975 |accessdate=25 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231125738/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/170807/review/5946986/sabotage |archivedate=31 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that "the magical chemistry that made such albums as ''Paranoid'' and ''Volume 4'' so special was beginning to disintegrate".<ref name="AMG Sabotage">{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sabotage-mw0000652467|title=Sabotage – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>

''Sabotage'' reached the top 20 in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but was the band's first release not to achieve Platinum status in the U.S., only achieving Gold certification.<ref name="riaa"/> Although the album's only single "[[Am I Going Insane (Radio)]]" failed to chart, ''Sabotage'' features fan favourites such as "[[Sabotage (Black Sabbath album)|Hole in the Sky]]", and "[[Symptom of the Universe (song)|Symptom of the Universe]]".<ref name="AMG Sabotage"/> Black Sabbath toured in support of ''Sabotage'' with openers [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975, following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back. In December 1975, the band's record companies released a greatest hits album without input from the band, titled ''[[We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll]]''. The album charted throughout 1976, eventually selling two million copies in the U.S.<ref name="riaa"/>

=== ''Technical Ecstasy'' and ''Never Say Die!'' (1976–1979) ===

Black Sabbath began work for their next album at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, Florida, in June 1976. To expand their sound, the band added keyboard player Gerry Woodruffe, who also had appeared to a lesser extent on ''Sabotage''. During the recording of ''[[Technical Ecstasy]]'', Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians.<ref name="osbourneautobiography" /> Recording of ''Technical Ecstasy'' was difficult; by the time the album was completed Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain.<ref name="osbourneautobiography" /> It was released on 25 September 1976 to mixed reviews, and (for the first time) later music critics gave the album less favourable retrospective reviews; two decades after its release AllMusic gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was "unravelling at an alarming rate".<ref name="TE AMG Review">{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/technical-ecstasy-mw0000197070|title=Technical Ecstasy – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. ''Technical Ecstasy'' failed to reach the top 50 in the U.S., and was the band's second consecutive release not to achieve platinum status, although it was later certified gold in 1997.<ref name="riaa"/> The album included "[[Dirty Women]]", which remains a live staple, as well as Ward's first lead vocal on the song "It's Alright".<ref name="TE AMG Review" /> Touring in support of ''Technical Ecstasy'' began in November 1976, with openers [[Boston (band)|Boston]] and [[Ted Nugent]] in the U.S., and completed in Europe with [[AC/DC]] in April 1977.<ref name="MusicMight"/>

In late 1977, while in rehearsal for their next album, and just days before the band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist [[Dave Walker]], a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Savoy Brown]], and informed him that Osbourne had left the band.<ref name="walker_interview">{{cite web |last=Saulnier |first=Jason |date=30 December 2011 |title=Dave Walker Interview – Black Sabbath Singer talks Never Say Die |url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-walker-interview-black-sabbath/ |publisher=musiclegends.ca |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref> Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath.<ref name="walker_interview" /><ref name="AMG Biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/black-sabbath-mn0000771438|title=Black Sabbath – Biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song "Junior's Eyes" on the BBC Television programme "Look! Hear!"<ref name="walker_interview" /> Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and came to the conclusion that Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath.<ref name="walker_interview" /> "The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me", Osbourne said. "I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=93–94}} Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the "Look! Hear!" footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them.<ref name="walker_interview" />

Osbourne initially set out to form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=93–94}}

The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, writing and recording what would become ''[[Never Say Die!]]''. "It took quite a long time", Iommi said. "We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=93–94}} The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the United Kingdom, and number 69 in the U.S. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse."<ref name="NSD AMG Review">{{cite web|last=Eduardo|first=Rivadavia|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/never-say-die%21-mw0000198810|title=Never Say Die – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The album featured the singles "[[Never Say Die (Black Sabbath song)|Never Say Die]]" and "[[Hard Road (Black Sabbath song)|Hard Road]]", both of which cracked the top 40 in the United Kingdom. The band also made their second appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', performing "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the U.S.<ref name="riaa"/>

Touring in support of ''Never Say Die!'' began in May 1978 with openers [[Van Halen]]. Reviewers called Black Sabbath's performance "tired and uninspired", a stark contrast to the "youthful" performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time.<ref name="MusicMight"/> The band filmed a performance at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as ''Never Say Die''. The final show of the tour, and Osbourne's last appearance with the band (until later reunions) was in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] on 11 December.

Following the tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne "was on a totally different level altogether".<ref name="iommiautobiography" /> The band would come up with new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them.<ref name="iommiautobiography" /> Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely.<ref name="iommiautobiography" /> "At that time, Ozzy had come to an end", Iommi said. "We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=95}} Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979.<ref name="osbourneautobiography" /> "I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid", Ward said. "Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=97}}

=== ''Heaven and Hell'' and ''Mob Rules'' (1979–1982) ===
Sharon Arden (later [[Sharon Osbourne]]), daughter of Black Sabbath manager [[Don Arden]], suggested former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] to replace Ozzy Osbourne in 1979. Don Arden was at this point still trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin the band, as he viewed the original line-up as the most profitable.<ref name="iommiautobiography" /> Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. "They were totally different altogether", Iommi explains. "Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing ''across'' the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in "Iron Man". Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=98}}

Geezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979 for personal reasons. According to Dio, the band initially hired [[Craig Gruber]] (with whom Dio had previously played while in [[Elf (band)|Elf]]) on bass to assist with writing the new album.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Gruber was soon replaced by [[Geoff Nicholls]] of [[Quartz (metal band)|Quartz]]. The new line-up returned to [[Criteria Studios]] in November to begin recording work, with Butler returning to the band in January 1980, and Nicholls moving to keyboards. Produced by [[Martin Birch]], ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' was released on 25 April 1980, to critical acclaim. Over a decade after its release AllMusic said the album was "one of Sabbath's finest records, the band sounds reborn and re-energised throughout".<ref>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/heaven-and-hell-mw0000649895|title=Heaven and Hell – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> ''Heaven and Hell'' peaked at number 9 in the United Kingdom, and number 28 in the U.S., the band's highest charting album since ''Sabotage''. The album eventually sold a million copies in the U.S.,<ref name="riaa"/> and the band embarked on an extensive world tour, making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980.

[[File:Black Sabbath Cardiff 1981.jpg|thumb|left|Black Sabbath performing in [[Cardiff]] in 1981]]

Black Sabbath toured the U.S. throughout 1980 with [[Blue Öyster Cult]] on the "Black and Blue" tour, with a show at [[Nassau Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] filmed and released theatrically in 1981 as ''[[Black and Blue (video)|Black and Blue]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |date=5 January 1981 |title=Brief Reviews: New Films |journal=New York Magazine |publisher=New York Media |volume=14 |issue=1 |page=72 |issn=0028-7369}}</ref> On 26 July 1980, the band played to 75,000 fans at a sold-out [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] with [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Cheap Trick]], and [[Molly Hatchet]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=9 August 1980 |title=Stadiums & Festivals |work=Billboard |volume=92 |issue=32 |page=34 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref>https://www.black-sabbath.com/tourdates/hh_tour/ 1980-1981 Heaven & Hell Tour setlist</ref> The next day, the band appeared at the 1980 [[Day on the Green]] at [[Oakland Coliseum]]. While on tour, Black Sabbath's former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven-year-old performance, titled ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'' without any input from the band. The album reached number five on the British charts, and saw the re-release of "Paranoid" as a single, which reached the top 20.<ref name="billboard_200"/>

On 18 August 1980, after a show in [[Minneapolis]], Ward quit the band. "It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated". Geezer Butler stated that after the show, Ward came in drunk, talking about the things where "He might as well be a Martian". Ward then got angry, and decided to pack his things, and get on a bus to leave. The group then brought in drummer [[Vinny Appice]] to replace Ward.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vinny Appice Interview|url= http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/vinny-appice-interview-black-sabbath/|publisher=Music Legends|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>

Unhappy with the quality of 1980's ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'', the band recorded another live album—titled ''[[Live Evil (Black Sabbath album)|Live Evil]]''—during the ''Mob Rules'' world tour, across the United States in [[Dallas]], [[San Antonio]], and [[Seattle]], in 1982.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Live Evil |others=Black Sabbath |year=1983 |chapter=Mob Rules World Tour 1981–1982 |first=Hugh |last=Gilmour |pages=3–5 |type=CD booklet; 1996 reissue |publisher=Gimcastle/Castle Communications |id=ESM CD 333 |location=England}}</ref> During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio.

Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=118}} "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do," Dio later said. "I refuse to listen to ''Live Evil'', because there are too many problems.

Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=107–108}}

Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start [[Dio (band)|his own band]], and took drummer Vinny Appice with him.

=== ''Born Again'' (1983–1984) ===
The remaining two original members, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, began auditioning new singers for the band's next release. [[Samson (band)|Samson]]'s [[Nicky Moore]], and [[Lone Star (band)|Lone Star]]'s [[John Sloman]] were considered and Iommi states in his autobiography that [[Michael Bolton]] auditioned for the band.{{sfn|Iommi|2012|p=218-219}} The band settled on former [[Deep Purple]] vocalist [[Ian Gillan]] to replace Ronnie James Dio in December 1982.<ref name="AMG Biography"/>{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=233–239}} While the project was not initially set to be called Black Sabbath, pressures from the record label forced the group to retain the name.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=233–239}} The band entered [[The Manor Studio]]s in [[Shipton-on-Cherwell]], Oxfordshire, in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] on drums.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=233–239}} ''[[Born Again (Black Sabbath album)|Born Again]]'' (7 August 1983) was panned upon release by critics. Despite the negative reception of the album, it reached number four on the UK charts, and number 39 in the U.S.<ref name="billboard_200"/> Even a decade after its release AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album "dreadful", noting that "Gillan's bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom".<ref name="Born Again AMG Review">{{cite web|last=Eduardo|first=Rivadavia|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/born-again-mw0000311503|title=Born Again – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>

Although he performed on the album, drummer Ward was unable to tour because of the pressures of the road, and quit the band after the commencement of the ''Born Again'' album. "I fell apart with the idea of touring", Ward later said. "I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=20215 |title=From Jazz to Black Sabbath |publisher=AllAboutJazz.com |accessdate=2 March 2008}}</ref> Ward was replaced by former [[Electric Light Orchestra]] drummer [[Bev Bevan]] for the [[Born Again Tour 1983|''Born Again'' '83 -'84 world tour]],{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=233–239}} (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 – '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with [[Diamond Head (band)|Diamond Head]], and later in the U.S. with [[Quiet Riot]] and [[Night Ranger]].

The [[Born Again Tour 1983|tour in support of ''Born Again'']] included a giant set of the [[Stonehenge]] monument. In a move that would be later parodied in the mockumentary ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece. As Geezer Butler later explained:

{{quote|We had Sharon Osbourne's dad, [[Don Arden]], managing us. He came up with the idea of having the stage set be Stonehenge. He wrote the dimensions down and gave it to our tour manager. He wrote it down in metres but he meant to write it down in feet. The people who made it saw fifteen metres instead of fifteen feet. It was 45 feet high and it wouldn't fit on any stage anywhere so we just had to leave it in the storage area. It cost a fortune to make but there was not a building on earth that you could fit it into.<ref name="Classic Rock Revisited interview"/>}}

=== Hiatus and ''Seventh Star'' (1984–1986) ===
[[File:Geoff Nicholls 1986.jpg|thumb|right|Geoff Nicholls in 1986.]]
Following the completion of the [[Born Again Tour 1983|''Born Again'' tour]] in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like "hired help" by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named [[David Donato]]. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer [[Bob Ezrin]] in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after.<ref name="AMG Biography"/> Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, Geezer Butler quit Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. "When Ian Gillan took over that was the end of it for me," he said. "I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to [[Warner Bros.]] and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it.

Following Butler's exit, sole remaining original member Iommi put Sabbath on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist [[Geoff Nicholls]]. While working on new material, the original Sabbath line-up agreed to a spot at [[Bob Geldof]]'s [[Live Aid]], performing at the [[Live Aid#JFK Stadium|Philadelphia]] show on 13 July 1985.<ref name="MusicMight"/>{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=233–239}} This event – which also featured reunions of [[The Who]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] – marked the first time the original line-up had appeared on stage since 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504968/live-aid-look-back.jhtml|title=Live Aid: A Look Back at a Concert That Actually Changed the World|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=29 June 2005|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref> "We were all drunk when we did Live Aid," recalled [[Geezer Butler]], "but we'd all got drunk separately."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Elliott|title=The last word|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|date=20 September 1997|p=62}}</ref>

Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist [[Dave Spitz]] (ex-[[Great White]]), drummer [[Eric Singer]] and initially intended to use multiple singers, including [[Rob Halford]] of [[Judas Priest]], former Deep Purple and [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]] vocalist [[Glenn Hughes]], and former Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio. This plan didn't work as he forecasted.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=233–239}} "We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=123}}

The band spent the remainder of the year in the studio, recording what would become ''[[Seventh Star]]'' (1986). Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath.<ref name="Seventh Star AMG Review">{{cite web|last=Eduardo|first=Rivadavia|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/seventh-star-mw0000192998|title=Seventh Star – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Pressured by the band's manager, [[Don Arden]], the two compromised and released the album as "Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi" in January 1986.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ann Vare|first=Ethlie|date=8 March 1986|title=Sabbath's 'Seventh Star' Spotlights Iommi|work=Billboard|location=Los Angeles|volume=98|issue=10|page=47|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> "It opened up a whole can of worms," Iommi explained.

It was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as AllMusic gave album verdicts, calling the album "often misunderstood and underrated".<ref name="Seventh Star AMG Review" />

The new line-up rehearsed for six weeks preparing for a full world tour, although the band were eventually forced to use the Sabbath name. "I was into the 'Tony Iommi project', but I wasn't into the Black Sabbath moniker," Hughes said. "The idea of being in Black Sabbath didn't appeal to me ''whatsoever''. Glenn Hughes singing in Black Sabbath is like [[James Brown]] singing in [[Metallica]].

=== ''The Eternal Idol'', ''Headless Cross'' and ''Tyr'' (1986–1990) ===
Black Sabbath began work on new material in October 1986 at [[Associated Independent Recording|Air Studios]] in [[Montserrat]] with producer [[Jeff Glixman]]. The recording was fraught with problems from the beginning, as Glixman left after the initial sessions to be replaced by producer [[Vic Coppersmith-Heaven]]. Bassist Dave Spitz quit over "personal issues", and former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]] bassist [[Bob Daisley]] was brought in. Daisley re-recorded all of the bass tracks, and wrote the album's lyrics, but before the album was complete, he left to join [[Gary Moore]]'s backing band, taking drummer [[Eric Singer]] with him.<ref name="AMG Biography"/> After problems with second producer Coppersmith-Heaven, the band returned to [[Morgan Studios]] in England in January 1987 to work with new producer [[Chris Tsangarides]]. While working in the United Kingdom, new vocalist Ray Gillen abruptly left Black Sabbath to form [[Blue Murder (band)|Blue Murder]] with guitarist [[John Sykes]] (ex-[[Tygers of Pan Tang]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Whitesnake]]). The band enlisted former [[Alliance (band)|Alliance]] vocalist [[Tony Martin (British singer)|Tony Martin]] to re-record Gillen's tracks, and former [[Electric Light Orchestra]] drummer [[Bev Bevan]] to complete a few percussion overdubs.<ref name="MusicMight"/> Before the release of the new album Black Sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], South Africa during the apartheid era. The band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with [[Artists United Against Apartheid]], who had been boycotting South Africa since 1985.{{sfn|Drewett|2006|p=27}} Drummer Bev Bevan refused to play the shows, and was replaced by [[Terry Chimes]], formerly of [[the Clash]].<ref name="MusicMight"/>

After nearly a year in production, ''[[The Eternal Idol]]'' was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers. On-line internet era reviews were mixed. AllMusic said that "Martin's powerful voice added new fire" to the band, and the album contained "some of Iommi's heaviest riffs in years."<ref name="Eternal Idol AMG Review">{{cite web|last=Eduardo|first=Rivadavia|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-eternal-idol-mw0000193232|title=Eternal Idol – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> ''Blender'' gave the album two stars, claiming the album was "Black Sabbath in name only".<ref name="Eternal Idol Blender Review">{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2225 |title=Blender Eternal Idol Review |publisher=Blender.com |accessdate=10 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019162809/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2225 |archivedate=19 October 2006 }}</ref> The album would stall at No. 66 in the United Kingdom, while peaking at 168 in the U.S.<ref name="billboard_200"/> The band toured in support of ''Eternal Idol'' in Germany, Italy and for the first time, Greece.

Following the poor commercial performance of ''The Eternal Idol'', Black Sabbath were dropped by both Vertigo Records and Warner Bros. Records, and signed with [[I.R.S. Records]].<ref name="MusicMight"/> The band took time off in 1988, returning in August to begin work on their next album. As a result of the recording troubles with ''Eternal Idol'', Tony Iommi opted to produce the band's next album himself. "It was a completely new start", Iommi said. "I had to rethink the whole thing, and decided that we needed to build up some credibility again".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=129}} Iommi enlisted former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] drummer [[Cozy Powell]], long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist [[Laurence Cottle]], and rented a "very cheap studio in England".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=129}}

Black Sabbath released ''[[Headless Cross]]'' in April 1989, and it was also ignored by contemporary reviewers, although AllMusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia gave the album four stars and called it "the finest non-Ozzy or Dio Black Sabbath album".<ref name="Headless Cross AMG Review">{{cite web|last=Eduardo|first=Rivadavia|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/headless-cross-mw0000203923|title=Headless Cross – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Anchored by the number 62 charting single "Headless Cross", the album reached number 31 on the UK charts, and number 115 in the U.S.<ref name="billboard_200"/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]], a good friend of Iommi's, played a guest solo on the song "When Death Calls".

The unsuccessful ''Headless Cross'' U.S. tour began in May 1989 with openers [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]] and [[Silent Rage]], but because of poor ticket sales, the tour was cancelled after just eight shows.<ref name="MusicMight"/> The European leg of the tour began in September, where the band were enjoying chart success.

The band returned to the studio in February 1990 to record ''[[Tyr (album)|Tyr]]'', the follow-up to ''Headless Cross''. While not technically a [[concept album]], some of the album's lyrical themes are loosely based on [[Norse mythology]].<ref name="MusicMight"/> ''Tyr'' was released on 6 August 1990, reaching number 24 on the UK albums chart, but was the first Black Sabbath release not to break the ''Billboard'' 200 in the U.S.<ref name="billboard_200"/> The album would receive mixed internet-era reviews, with AllMusic noting that the band "mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis",<ref name="Tyr AMG Review">{{cite web|last=Chrispell|first=James|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tyr-mw0000690225|title=Tyr – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> while ''Blender'' gave the album just one star, claiming that "Iommi continues to besmirch the Sabbath name with this unremarkable collection".<ref name="Tyr Blender Review">{{cite web|last=Mitchell |first=Ben |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2228 |title=Tyr Blender review |publisher=Blender.com |accessdate=11 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019162755/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2228 |archivedate=19 October 2006 }}</ref> The band toured in support of ''Tyr'' with [[Circus of Power]] in Europe, but the final seven United Kingdom dates were cancelled because of poor ticket sales.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dwyer |first=Robert |url=http://sabbathlive.com/lists/CG90TYR.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219022836/http://sabbathlive.com/lists/CG90TYR.html |archivedate=19 December 2005 |title=Sabbath Live Timeline 1990s Cancelled shows |publisher=SabbathLive.com |accessdate=11 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> For the first time in their career, the band's touring cycle did not include U.S. dates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dwyer |first=Robert |url=http://www.sabbathlive.com/lists/90TYR.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116055140/http://www.sabbathlive.com/lists/90TYR.html |archivedate=16 January 2006 |title=Sabbath Live Timeline 1990s |publisher=SabbathLive.com |accessdate=11 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>

=== ''Dehumanizer'' (1990–1992) ===
[[File:Heaven And Hell 4.jpg|thumb|right|Following a performance in 1990, both Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler expressed interest in rejoining Black Sabbath.]]

While on his ''[[Lock Up the Wolves]]'' U.S. tour in August 1990, former Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio was joined onstage at the [[Roy Wilkins Auditorium]] by Geezer Butler to perform "Neon Knights". Following the show, the two expressed interest in rejoining Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current lineup, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. "I do regret that in a lot of ways," Iommi said. "We were at a good point then. We decided to [reunite with Dio] and I don't even know why, really. There's the financial aspect, but that wasn't it. I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=129}}

Dio and Butler joined Iommi and [[Cozy Powell]] in autumn 1990 to begin the next Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell suffered a broken hip when his horse died and fell on the drummer's legs.<ref name="Blender Review">{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2229 |title=Blender Dehumanizer Review |publisher=Blender.com |accessdate=17 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019162836/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2229 |archivedate=19 October 2006 }}</ref> Unable to complete the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer [[Vinny Appice]], reuniting the ''Mob Rules'' lineup, and the band entered the studio with producer [[Reinhold Mack]]. The year-long recording was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Songs were rewritten multiple times.{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=128}} "It was just hard work," Iommi said. "We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=129}} Dio recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort: "It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works. Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album".<ref name="Iommi & Dio Interview">{{cite web |last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=65255 |title=Interview with Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=17 March 2008}}</ref>

The resulting ''[[Dehumanizer]]'' was released on 22 June 1992. In the U.S., the album was released on 30 June 1992 by [[Reprise Records]], as Dio and his [[Dio (band)|namesake band]] were still under contract to the label at the time. While the album received mixed {{nowrap|reviews,<ref name="Blender Review"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revelationz.net/index.asp?ID=2381e |title=Revelation Z Magazine ''Dehumanizer'' Review |publisher=RevolutionZ.net |accessdate=17 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604221624/http://www.revelationz.net/index.asp?ID=2381e |archivedate=4 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}, it was the band's biggest commercial success in a decade.<ref name="AMG Biography"/> Anchored by the top 40 rock radio single "TV Crimes", the album peaked at number 44 on the ''Billboard 200.''<ref name="billboard_200"/> The album also featured "Time Machine", a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. Additionally, the perception among fans of a return of some semblance of the "real" Sabbath provided the band with much needed momentum.

Sabbath began touring in support of ''Dehumanizer'' in July 1992 with [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]], and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]]. While on tour, former vocalist Ozzy Osbourne announced his first retirement, and invited Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his ''[[No More Tears|No More Tours]]'' tour in [[Costa Mesa, California]]. The band agreed, aside from Dio, who told Iommi, "I'm not doing that. I'm not supporting a clown."<ref name="iommiautobiography" /> Dio spoke of the situation years later:

{{quote|I was told in the middle of the tour that we would be opening for Ozzy in Los Angeles. And I said, "No. Sorry, I have more pride than that." A lot of bad things were being said from camp to camp, and it created this horrible schism. So by [the band] agreeing to play the shows in L.A. with Ozzy, that, to me, spelled out reunion. And that obviously meant the doom of that particular project.<ref name="Iommi & Dio Interview"/>}}

Dio quit Sabbath following a show in [[Oakland, California]] on 13 November 1992, one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne's retirement show. Judas Priest vocalist [[Rob Halford]] stepped in at the last minute, performing two nights with the band.<ref>{{cite web| last=Henderson |first=Tim |url=http://www.bravewords.com/features/1000484 |title=Rob Halford Reminisces About Covering For OZZY! |publisher=BraveWords.com |accessdate=17 March 2008}}</ref> Iommi and Butler joined Osbourne and former drummer Ward on stage for the first time since 1985's [[Live Aid]] concert, performing a brief set of Sabbath songs. This set the stage for a longer-term reunion of the original lineup, though that plan proved short-lived. "Ozzy, Geezer, Tony and Bill announced the reunion of Black Sabbath – again," remarked Dio. "And I thought that it was a great idea. But I guess Ozzy didn't think it was such a great idea… I'm never surprised when it comes to whatever happens with them. Never at all. They are very predictable. They don't talk."<ref>Swedish TV interview, broadcast April 1994, transcribed by Ola Malmström in Sabbath [[fanzine]] ''Southern Cross'' #14, p18, October 1994</ref>

=== ''Cross Purposes'' and ''Forbidden'' (1993–1996) ===
Drummer [[Vinny Appice]] left the band following the reunion show to join Ronnie James Dio's solo band, later appearing on Dio's ''[[Strange Highways]]'' and ''[[Angry Machines]]''. Iommi and Butler enlisted former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] drummer [[Bobby Rondinelli]], and reinstated former vocalist [[Tony Martin (British singer)|Tony Martin]]. The band returned to the studio to work on new material, although the project was not originally intended to be released under the Black Sabbath name. As Geezer Butler explains:

{{quote|It wasn't even supposed to be a Sabbath album; I wouldn't have even done it under the pretence of Sabbath. That was the time when the original band were talking about getting back together for a reunion tour. Tony and myself just went in with a couple of people, did an album just to have, while the reunion tour was (supposedly) going on. It was like an Iommi/Butler project album.{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=130}}}}

Under pressure from their record label, the band released their seventeenth studio album, ''[[Cross Purposes]]'', on 8 February 1994, under the Black Sabbath name. The album received mixed reviews, with ''Blender'' giving the album two stars, calling [[Soundgarden]]'s 1994 album ''[[Superunknown]]'' "a far better Sabbath album than this by-the-numbers potboiler".<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell |first=Ben |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2226 |title=Blender Cross Purposes Review |publisher=Blender.com |accessdate=18 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019162651/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2226 |archivedate=19 October 2006 }}</ref> AllMusic's Bradley Torreano called ''Cross Purposes'' "the first album since ''Born Again'' that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record".<ref>{{cite web|last=Torreano|first=Bradley|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/cross-purposes-mw0000107297|title=Cross Purposes – Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The album just missed the Top 40 in the UK reaching number 41, and also reached 122 on the ''Billboard'' 200 in the U.S. ''Cross Purposes'' contained the song "Evil Eye", which was co-written by [[Van Halen]] guitarist [[Eddie Van Halen]], although uncredited because of record label restrictions.<ref name="MusicMight"/> Touring in support of ''Cross Purposes'' began in February with [[Morbid Angel]] and [[Motörhead]] in the U.S. The band filmed a live performance at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] on 13 April 1994, which was released on VHS accompanied by a CD, titled ''[[Cross Purposes Live]]''. After the European tour with [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]] and [[Godspeed (band)|Godspeed]] in June 1994, drummer Bobby Rondinelli quit the band and was replaced by original Black Sabbath drummer Ward for five shows in South America.

[[Image:Butlernov95.jpg|thumb|left|portrait|[[Geezer Butler]] in 1995]]

Following the touring cycle for ''Cross Purposes'', bassist Geezer Butler quit the band for the second time. "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much preferred the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing".{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=130}} Butler formed a solo project called [[GZR]], and released ''[[Plastic Planet]]'' in 1995. The album contained the song "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: ''You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone''{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=51}} ("I heard it's something about me..." said Iommi. "I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really paid any attention to the lyrics... It's nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend."<ref name="ReferenceA">''Southern Cross'' No.19, March 1997</ref>

Following Butler's departure, newly returned drummer Ward once again left the band. Iommi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass and Cozy Powell on drums, effectively reuniting the 1990 ''Tyr'' line-up. The band enlisted [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]] guitarist [[Ernie C]] to produce the new album, which was recorded in London in autumn of 1994.

Black Sabbath embarked on a world tour in July 1995 with openers [[Motörhead]] and [[Tiamat]], but two months into the tour, drummer Cozy Powell left the band, citing health issues, and was replaced by former drummer [[Bobby Rondinelli]]. "The members I had in the last lineup – Bobby Rondinelli, Neil Murray – they're great, great characters..." Iommi told Sabbath fanzine ''Southern Cross''. "That, for me, was an ideal lineup. I wasn't sure vocally what we should do, but Neil Murray and Bobby Rondinelli I really got on well with."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

After completing Asian dates in December 1995, Tony Iommi put the band on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with former Black Sabbath vocalist [[Glenn Hughes]], and former Judas Priest drummer [[Dave Holland (drummer)|Dave Holland]]. The album was not officially released following its completion, although a widely traded bootleg called ''Eighth Star'' surfaced soon after.

In 1997, Tony Iommi disbanded the current line-up to officially reunite with Ozzy Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath line-up. Vocalist Tony Martin claimed that an original line-up reunion had been in the works since the band's brief reunion at Ozzy Osbourne's 1992 [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]] show, and that the band released subsequent albums to fulfill their record contract with I.R.S.

And then it grew as it went on… We were concerned in case Bill couldn't make it – couldn't do it – because it was a lot of dates, and important dates… The only rehearsal that we had to do was for the drummer. But I think if Bill had come in, it would have took a lot more time. We would have had to focus a lot more on him."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Peter|last=Scott|title=Tony Iommi interview|magazine=Southern Cross ''[Sabbath fanzine]'' #20|date=October 1997|p=14}}</ref>

In December 1997, the group was joined by Ward, marking the first reunion of the original quartet since Osbourne's 1992 "retirement show". This lineup recorded two shows at the [[National Exhibition Centre|Birmingham NEC]], released as the double album ''[[Reunion (Black Sabbath album)|Reunion]]'' on 20 October 1998. The album reached number eleven on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name="billboard_200"/> went platinum in the U.S.<ref name="riaa"/> and spawned the single "[[Iron Man (song)|Iron Man]]", which won Sabbath their first [[Grammy Award]] in 2000 for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]], 30 years after the song was originally released. ''Reunion'' featured two new studio tracks, "[[Psycho Man (Black Sabbath song)|Psycho Man]]" and "Selling My Soul", both of which cracked the top 20 of the ''Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks'' chart.<ref name="billboard_200"/>

Shortly before a European tour in the summer of 1998, Ward suffered a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer [[Vinny Appice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68263 |title=HEAVEN AND HELL Drummer: RONNIE JAMES DIO Is 'Singing Better Than He Has Ever Sung'|publisher=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=8 April 2008}}</ref> Ward returned for a U.S. tour with openers [[Pantera]], which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer, headlining the annual Ozzfest tour.<ref name="AMG Biography"/> Following these appearances, the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material. Iommi released his first official solo album, ''[[Iommi (album)|Iommi]]'', in 2000, while Osbourne continued work on ''[[Down to Earth (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Down to Earth]]'' (2001).

===''The Dio Years'' and Heaven & Hell (2006–2010)===
{{main|Heaven & Hell (band)}}
[[File:Iommi at the Forum.jpg|thumb|right|Tony Iommi in 2007 with Heaven & Hell]]

While Ozzy Osbourne was working on [[Black Rain (Ozzy Osbourne album)|new solo album]] material in 2006, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released ''[[Black Sabbath: The Dio Years]]'', a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. ''The Dio Years'' was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the ''Billboard'' 200, while the single "The Devil Cried" reached number 37 on the ''Mainstream Rock Tracks'' chart.<ref name="billboard_200"/> Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the 1981 ''Mob Rules'' era line-up for a [[Heaven and Hell 2007 Tour|world tour]]. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about the name of the group, Iommi stated "it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [and] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again."<ref name="Black Sabbath member history"/>
Ward was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with "a couple of the band members".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=135471|title=Ward on Quitting Heaven & Hell: I Was Uncomfortable With Some Things Surrounding The Project|last=Russell|first=Tom|date=20 February 2010|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=21 February 2010}}</ref> He was replaced by former drummer [[Vinny Appice]], effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the ''Mob Rules'' (1981) and ''Dehumanizer'' (1992) albums.

Heaven & Hell toured the U.S. with openers [[Megadeth]] and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, titled ''[[Live from Radio City Music Hall]]''. In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album, which was recorded in the following year.<ref>{{cite web |last=Elliott |first=Mike |url=http://www.komodorock.com/interviews/interviews/komodo-rock-talks-with-ronnie-james-dio-200711012460/ |title=Komodo Rock Talks With Ronnie James Dio |publisher=Komodorock.com |accessdate=8 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320074153/http://www.komodorock.com/interviews/interviews/komodo-rock-talks-with-ronnie-james-dio-200711012460/ |archivedate=20 March 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the [[Metal Masters Tour]], alongside [[Judas Priest]], [[Motörhead]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=95359 |title=JUDAS PRIEST Frontman On 'Metal Masters' Tour: 'We Insisted On A Classic Metal Package' |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=25 April 2008}}</ref> The box set, ''[[The Rules of Hell]]'', featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour. In 2009, the band announced the name of their debut studio album, ''[[The Devil You Know (Heaven & Hell album)|The Devil You Know]]'', released on 28 April.<ref name=billb09>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269438/heaven-hell-feeling-devilish-on-new-album |title=Heaven & Hell Feeling Devilish on New Album |accessdate=13 February 2009 |last=Cohen |first=Jonathan |date=10 February 2009 |work=Billboard |publisher=Howard Appelbaum}}</ref>

On 26 May 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41-year career, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Chris|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ozzy-osbourne-suing-tony-iommi-for-black-sabbath-name-20090529|title=Ozzy Osbourne Suing Tony Iommi For Black Sabbath Name|work=Rolling Stone|date=29 May 2009|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>

On 4 March 2016, Iommi discussed future re-releases of the [[Tony Martin (British singer)|Tony Martin]]-era catalogue.

Early on Black Sabbath were influenced by [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[the Beatles]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience|Jimi Hendrix]], [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]], [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iommi.com/archive/the_holy_sabbath.htm|title=The Holy Sabbath: Ozzy and Tony talk drugs, the devil and how they invented heavy metal|website=Iommi.com|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=9 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65rughoLC?url=http://www.iommi.com/archive/the_holy_sabbath.htm|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/black-sabbath-s-geezer-butler-talks-lyrical-inspiration-rock-band-iron-man-movies/|title=Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler talks lyrical inspiration, 'Rock Band', 'Iron Man' Movies|website=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref>

Although Black Sabbath went through many line-ups and stylistic changes, their core sound focuses on ominous lyrics and doomy music,<ref name="Black Sabbath's song review" /> often making use of the musical [[tritone]], also called the "devil's interval".{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=72}} While their Ozzy-era albums such as ''[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]'' (1973) had slight compositional similarities to the [[progressive rock]] genre that was growing in popularity at the time,<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Huey |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sabotage-mw0000652467 |title=Sabotage – Black Sabbath &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s Black Sabbath's dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era.<ref name="AMG Biography" /> Much like many of their early [[Traditional heavy metal|heavy metal]] contemporaries, the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio.{{sfn|Barnet|Burriss|2001|pp=87–88}}

As the band's primary songwriter, Tony Iommi wrote the majority of Black Sabbath's music, while Osbourne would write vocal melodies, and bassist Geezer Butler would write lyrics. The process was sometimes frustrating for Iommi, who often felt pressured to come up with new material: "If I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything."{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=76}} On Iommi's influence, Osbourne later said:

{{quote|Black Sabbath never used to write a structured song. There'd be a long intro that would go into a jazz piece, then go all folky... and it worked. Tony Iommi—and I have said this a zillion times—should be up there with the greats. He can pick up a guitar, play a riff, and you say, 'He's gotta be out now, he can't top that.' Then you come back, and I bet you a billion dollars, he'd come up with a riff that'd knock your fucking socks off.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sprague |first=David |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/articles/story/9438157/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_2006_black_sabbath |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2006: Black Sabbath |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=25 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603174719/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/articles/story/9438157/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_2006_black_sabbath |archivedate=3 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> }}

Beginning with their third album, ''[[Master of Reality]]'' (1971), Black Sabbath began to feature [[guitar tunings|tuned-down]] guitars.<ref name="AMG Biography"/> In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi suffered an accident while working in a [[sheet metal]] factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to [[Django Reinhardt]], a [[jazz]] guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire.{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=135}} Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his [[prosthesis]]. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different [[dropped tuning]]s, including C{{music|sharp}} tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E{{music|flat}}/D{{music|sharp}} tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.<ref name=inter>{{cite web|url=http://iommi.com/images/spread.jpg |title=Tony Iommi interview |accessdate=1 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305020833/http://iommi.com/images/spread.jpg |archivedate=5 March 2009 }}</ref>

{{quote|Black Sabbath has been so influential in the development of heavy metal rock music as to be a defining force in the style. The group took the blues-rock sound of late '60s acts like [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Blue Cheer]], and [[Vanilla Fudge]] to its logical conclusion, slowing the tempo, accentuating the bass, and emphasising screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies. If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition, Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction, and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later.<ref name="AMG Biography"/>}}

According to ''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} Holly George-Warren, "Black Sabbath was the heavy metal king of the 70s."<ref name="HGW">{{cite book|editor1-last=George-Warren|editor1-first=Holly|year=2001|title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll|edition= 2005|publisher=Fireside|isbn=978-0-7432-9201-6|pages=81–82}}</ref> Although initially "despised by rock critics and ignored by radio programmers", the group sold more than 8 million albums by the end of that decade.<ref name="HGW" />

According to [[Tracii Guns]] of [[L.A. Guns]] and former member of [[Guns N' Roses]], the main riff of "[[Paradise City]]" by [[Guns N' Roses]], from ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), was influenced by the song "Zero the Hero" from the ''[[Born Again (Black Sabbath album)|Born Again]]'' album.<ref>Martin Popoff, ''The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Time'', Ecw Press, 2002, p.135</ref> [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] guitarist [[Andy LaRocque]] affirmed that the clean guitar part of "Sleepless Nights" from ''[[Conspiracy (King Diamond album)|Conspiracy]]'' (1989) is inspired by Tony Iommi's playing on ''[[Never Say Die!]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kkdowning.net/Interviews/larocque.htm |title=Andy LaRocque interview |publisher=kkdowning.net |date=May 2008 |accessdate=27 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202701/http://www.kkdowning.net/Interviews/larocque.htm |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In addition to being pioneers of heavy metal, they also have been credited for laying the foundations for heavy metal subgenres [[stoner rock]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Ratliff |first=Ben |date=22 June 2000 |title=Rated R review |work=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/233746/review/5943680 |accessdate=19 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203020527/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/233746/review/5943680 |archivedate=3 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> [[sludge metal]],<ref name="AMG-Eyehategod">{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eyehategod-mn0000127103|title=Eyehategod – Biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/arts/music/05wpop.html?pagewanted=2&sq=Melvins%20sludge&st=cse&scp=1&_r=0|title=Pop/Jazz Listings|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 October 2007|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> [[thrash metal]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Torreano|first=Bradley|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/symptom-of-the-universe-mt0012259115|title=Symptom of the Universe – Song Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref> [[black metal]] and [[doom metal]] as well as for [[alternative rock]] subgenre [[grunge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/grunge-ma0000002626|title=Grunge|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> According to the critic [[Bob Gulla]], the band's sound "shows up in virtually all of grunge's most popular bands, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Alice in Chains]]".<ref>Bob Gulla, ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History: The grunge and post-grunge years, 1991–2005'', Greenwood Press, 2006, p.231</ref>

Tony Iommi has been credited as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The tips of his fingers were severed in a steel factory,<ref>{{cite web|last=Graff|first=Gary|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/465276/black-sabbath-reunion-coming-were-talking-says-tony-iommi|title=Black Sabbath Reunion Coming? 'We're Talking,' Says Tony Iommi|work=Billboard|date=7 November 2011|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.<ref>Rosen, Steven. "Black Sabbath – Uncensored on the Record". p.1928. Coda Books Ltd. Retrieved 19 June 2012</ref>

Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film ''[[Almost Famous]]'', [[Lester Bangs]] gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication ''Trebuchet Magazine'' has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/honest-and-unmerciful-writers-on-black-sabbath/|title=Honest and Unmerciful – Writers on Black Sabbath|publisher=Trebuchet Magazine|date=9 August 2012|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>
