Alternative Classifier: We exclude categories that do not classify computer
languages by any kind of software concept, purpose or language family. Thus, we
are neither interested in classifying a computer language based on its influence as
presented in ‘Academic programming languages’ nor those classifying by creation
year as in ‘Programming languages by creation date’.

Deviating Classifier: We exclude categories that do not represent a computer
languages classifier at all. For example, any eponymous category serves as a
container of related topics and is not relevant for classification. Additionally,
categories classifying software that can be identified as subcategories such as
‘Software by programming language’ are excluded this way as well.

List Classifier: We exclude categories that serve as collections of articles covering lists of entities such as ‘Lists of programming languages’.

Maintenance Pages: We exclude any category and article that only serves the
overview and maintenance of Wikipedia pages, e.g., ‘Wikipedia categories named
after programming languages’ and ‘Uncategorized programming languages’.

The inclusion criteria can be summarized as follows. Any category is included
that provides a classification based on a software concept or purpose of a computer language. A purpose of a language is for example expressed by ‘Hardware
description languages’ that contains only languages meant to be used for describing a hardware’s properties. Since we are interested in the similarity of computer
languages, we include the categories that represent language families such as ‘C
programming language family’.
We also include languages that come with systems, such as MATLAB, if and only if the language is explicitly mentioned by name
in the Wikipedia article.
