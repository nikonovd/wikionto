Query_language:Query languages are computer languages used to make queries in databases and information systems.
Algebraic_modeling_language:Algebraic Modeling Languages  are high-level computer programming languages for describing and solving high complexity problems for large scale mathematical computation . One particular advantage of some algebraic modeling languages like AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS ,OPL orXpress-Mosel  is the similarity of their syntax to the mathematical notation of optimization problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of optimization, which is supported by certain language elements like sets, indices, algebraic expressions, powerful sparse index and data handling variables, constraints with arbitrary names. The algebraic formulation of a model does not contain any hints how to process it. An AML does not solve those problems directly; instead, it calls appropriate external algorithms to obtain a solution. These algorithms are called solvers and can handle certain kind of mathematical problems like:
*  linear problems
*  integer problems
*   quadratic problems
*  mixed complementarity problems
*  mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints
*  constrained nonlinear systems
*  general nonlinear problems
*  non-linear programs with discontinuous derivatives
*  nonlinear integer problems
*  global optimization problems
*  stochastic optimization problems
Microsoft_Office_XML_formats:The Microsoft Office XML formats are XML-based document formats  introduced in versions of Microsoft Office prior to Office 2007. Microsoft Office XP introduced a new XML format for storing Excel spreadsheets and Office 2003 added an XML-based format for Word documents. These formats were succeeded by Office Open XML  in Microsoft Office 2007.
Abstract-Type_and_Scheme-Definition_Language:ASDL is also a common misspelling of ADSL. Abstract-Type and Scheme-Definition Language  is a computer language developed as part of ESPRIT project GRASPIN, as a basis for generating language-based editors and environments. It combines an object-oriented type system, syntax-directed translation schemes and a target-language interface.
Albatross_(programming_language):Albatrossis a general purpose programming language which can be verified statically.
BlooP_and_FlooP:BlooP and FlooP are simple programming languages designed by Douglas Hofstadter to illustrate a point in his book Gödel, Escher, Bach. BlooP is a non-Turing-complete programming language whose main control flow structure is a bounded loop . All programs in the language must terminate, and this language can only express primitive recursive functions. FlooP is identical to BlooP except that it supports unbounded loops; it is a Turing-complete language and can express all computable functions. For example, it can express the Ackermann function, which  cannot be written in BlooP. Borrowing from standard terminology in mathematical logic, Hofstadter calls FlooP's unbounded loops MU-loops. Like all Turing-complete programming languages, FlooP suffers from the halting problem: programs might not terminate, and it is not possible, in general, to decide which programs do. BlooP and FlooP can be regarded as models of computation, and have sometimes been used in teaching computability.
Chinese_character_description_languages:The Chinese character description languages are several proposed languages to most accurately and completely describe Chinese  characters and information such as their list of components, list of strokes , their order, and the location of each of them on a background empty square. They are designed to overcome the inherent lack of information within a bitmap description. This enriched information can be used to identify variants of characters that are unified into one code point by Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646, as well as to provide an alternative form of encoding for rare characters that do not yet have a standardized encoding in Unicode or ISO/IEC 10646. Many aim to work for Kaishu style and Song style, as well as to provide the character's internal structure which can be used for easier look-up of a character by indexing the character's internal make-up and cross-referencing among similar characters.
Cilk:Cilk, Cilk++ and Cilk Plus are general-purpose programming languages designed for multithreaded parallel computing. They are based on the C and C++ programming languages, which they extend these with constructs to express parallel loops and the fork–join idiom. Originally developed in the 1990s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  in the group of Charles E. Leiserson, Cilk was later commercialized as Cilk++ by a spinoff company, Cilk Arts. That company was subsequently acquired by Intel, which increased compatibility with existing C and C++ code, calling the result Cilk Plus.
ECL_programming_language:The ECL programming language and system were an extensible high-level programming language and development environment developed at Harvard University in the 1970s. The name 'ECL' stood for 'Extensible Computer Language' or 'EClectic Language'. Some publications used the name 'ECL' for the entire system and 'EL/1'  for the language itself. ECL was an interactive system where programs were represented within the system; there was a compatible compiler and interpreter. It had an ALGOL-like syntax and an extensible data type system, with data types as first-class citizens. Data objects were values, not references, and the calling conventions gave a choice between call by value and call by reference for each argument. ECL was primarily used for research and teaching in programming language design, programming methodology , and programming environments at Harvard, though it was said to be used at some government agencies as well. It was first implemented on the PDP-10, with a later  implementation on the PDP-11 written in BLISS-11 and cross-compiled on the PDP-10.
Expression-oriented_programming_language:ALGOL 68 and Lisp are examples of expression-oriented languages. Pascal is not an expression-oriented language. All functional programming languages are expression-oriented.
Intermediate_representation:An Intermediate representation  is the data structure or code used internally by a compiler or virtual machine to represent source code. An IR is designed to be conducive for further processing, such as optimization and translation. A "good" IR must be accurate – capable of representing the source code without loss of information – and independent of any particular source or target language. An IR may take one of several forms: an in-memory data structure, or a special tuple- or stack-based code readable by the program. In the latter case it is also called an intermediate language. A canonical example is found in most modern compilers, where the linear human-readable text representing a program is transformed into an intermediate graph structure that allows flow analysis and re-arrangement before creating a sequence of actual CPU instructions. Use of an intermediate representation such as this allows compiler systems like the GNU Compiler Collection and LLVM to be used by many different source languages to generate code for many different target architectures.
Newsqueak:Squeak and its successor Newsqueak are concurrent programming languages for writing application software with interactive graphical user interfaces. Squeak was designed by Luca Cardelli and Rob Pike at Bell Labs in the first half of the 1980s; Newsqueak was a further development by Pike. Both languages were presented as "a language for communicating with mice": their main aim was to model the concurrent nature of programs interacting with multiple input devices, viz., keyboards and mice. Newsqueak's syntax and semantics are influenced by the C language, but its approach to concurrency was inspired by C. A. R. Hoare's communicating sequential processes . However, in Newsqueak, channels are first-class objects, with dynamic process creation and dynamic channel creation. Newsqueak was developed from an earlier, smaller, language, called Squeak . It was developed by Luca Cardelli and Rob Pike as a language for implementing graphical user interfaces. The ideas present in Newsqueak were further developed in the programming languages Alef, Limbo, and Go.
Pattern_directed_invocation_programming_language:In computer science, pattern-directed invocation programming languages are programming languages in which procedures are invoked indirectly by specifying a pattern for a set of procedures as opposed to specifying one directly by name, pointer, URL, etc., as in conventional programming. These languages were initiated by Planner which featured high level plans invoked by patterns for assertions and goals. They include logic programming languages such as Prolog as a special case. Ether was a pattern-directed invocation language introduced in the Scientific Community Metaphor. Pattern-directed invocation is a commonly used and more practical alternative to first-order theorem proving in automated theorem proving, and is the primary method of implementing a blackboard system for automated reasoning in general. In it, a database of facts  is augmented with a set of procedures called demons. A demon is automatically invoked whenever a term matching the demon's pattern is added to the database. Pattern-directed invocation is related to rule-based programming.
Vector_addition_system:A vector addition system consists of a finite set of integer vectors. An initial vector is seen as the initial values of multiple counters, and the vectors of the VAS are seen as updates. These counters may never drop below zero. More precisely, given an initial vector with non negative values, the vectors of the VAS can be added componentwise, given that every intermediate vector has non negative values. A vector addition system with states is a VAS equipped with control states. More precisely, it is a finite directed graph with arcs labelled by integer vectors. VASS have the same restriction that the counter values should never drop below zero.
Darwin_Core_Archive:Darwin Core Archive  is a biodiversity informatics data standard that makes use of the Darwin Core terms to produce a single, self-contained dataset for species occurrence or checklist data. Essentially it is a set of text  files with a simple descriptor  to inform others how your files are organized. The format is defined in the Darwin Core Text Guidelines. It is the preferred format for publishing data to the GBIF network.
Deforestation_(computer_science):In the theory of programming languages in computer science, deforestation  is a program transformation to eliminate tree structures. The term "deforestation" was originally coined by Philip Wadler in his paper "Deforestation: transforming programs to eliminate trees". Deforestation is typically applied to programs in functional programming languages, particularly non-strict programming languages such as Haskell. One particular algorithm for deforestation, shortcut deforestation, is implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
MetaQuotes_Language_MQL4/MQL5:MQL4  and MQL5  are integrated programming languages designed for developing trading robots, technical market indicators, scripts and function libraries within the MetaTrader software. The primary objective of MQL4 and MQL5 is automation of trading and facilitation of operational analysis. MQL4 and MQL5 comprises an extensive codebase source code library used for developing trading robots.
Ontology_language:In computer science and artificial intelligence, ontology languages are formal languages used to construct ontologies. They allow the encoding of knowledge about specific domains and often include reasoning rules that support the processing of that knowledge. Ontology languages are usually declarative languages, are almost always generalizations of frame languages, and are commonly based on either first-order logic or on description logic.
Simula:Simula is the name of two simulation programming languages, Simula I and Simula 67, developed in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo, by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard. Syntactically, it is a fairly faithful superset of ALGOL 60. Simula 67 introduced objects, classes, inheritance and subclasses, virtual procedures, coroutines, and discrete event simulation, and features garbage collection. Also other forms of subtyping  were introduced in Simula derivatives. Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. As its name suggests, Simula was designed for doing simulations, and the needs of that domain provided the framework for many of the features of object-oriented languages today. Simula has been used in a wide range of applications such as simulating VLSI designs, process modeling, protocols, algorithms, and other applications such as typesetting, computer graphics, and education. The influence of Simula is often understated, and Simula-type objects are reimplemented in C++, Object Pascal, Java, C# and several other languages. The creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, has acknowledged that Simula 67 was the greatest influence on him to develop C++, to bring the kind of productivity enhancements offered by Simula to the raw computational speed offered by lower level languages like BCPL.
Visual_Basic_.NET:Visual Basic .NET  is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language, implemented on the .NET Framework. Microsoft launched VB.NET in 2002 as the successor to its original Visual Basic language. Although the ".NET" portion was dropped in 2005, this article uses "Visual Basic [.NET]" to refer to all Visual Basic languages releases since 2002, in order to distinguish between them and the classic Visual Basic. Along with Visual C#, it is one of the two main languages targeting the .NET framework. Microsoft's integrated development environment  for developing in Visual Basic .NET language is Visual Studio. Most of Visual Studio editions are commercial; the only exceptions are Visual Studio Express and Visual Studio Community, which are freeware. In addition, .NET Framework SDK includes a freeware command-line compiler called vbc.exe. Mono also includes a command-line VB.NET compiler.
Harmonic_wavelet_transform:In the mathematics of signal processing, the harmonic wavelet transform, introduced by David Edward Newland in 1993, is a wavelet-based linear transformation of a given function into a time-frequency representation. It combines advantages of the short-time Fourier transform and the continuous wavelet transform. It can be expressed in terms of repeated Fourier transforms, and its discrete analogue can be computed efficiently using a fast Fourier transform algorithm.
Biome:A biome /ˈbaɪoʊm/ is a formation of plants and animals that have common characteristics due to similar climates and can be found over a range of continents. Spanning continents, Biomes are distinct biological communities that have formed in response to a shared physical climate. Biomes are distinct from habitats, because any biome can comprise a variety of habitats. A biome contrasts with a microbiome. A microbiome is also a mix of organisms that coexist in a defined space, but on a much smaller scale. For example, the human microbiome is the collection of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that are present on a human.
Homeosis:Homeosis is the transformation of one organ into another, arising from mutation in or misexpression of specific developmentally critical genes. In animals, these developmental genes specifically control the development of organs on their anteroposterior axis. In plants, however, the developmental genes affected by homeosis may control anything from the development of a stamen or petals to the development of chlorophyll. Homeosis may be caused by mutations in Hox genes, found in animals, or others such as the MADS-box family in plants. Homeosis is a characteristic that has helped insects become as successful and diverse as they are. Homeotic mutations work by changing segment identity during development. For example, the Ultrabithorax genotype gives a phenotype wherein metathoracic and first abdominal segments become mesothoracic segments. Another well-known example is Antennapedia: a gain-of-function allele causes legs to develop in the place of antennae. In botany, Rolf Sattler has revised the concept of homeosis  by his emphasis of partial homeosis in addition to complete homeosis, which is commonly accepted. Homeotic mutants in angiosperms are thought to be rare in the wild: in the annual plant Clarkia , homeotic mutants are known where the petals are replaced by a second whorl of sepal like organs, originating via a mutation governed by a single recessive gene. The absence of lethal or deleterious consequences in floral mutants resulting in distinct morphological expressions has been a factor in the evolution of Clarkia, and perhaps also in many other plant groups.
Transaction_processing:In computer science, transaction processing is information processing that is divided into individual, indivisible operations called transactions. Each transaction must succeed or fail as a complete unit; it can never be only partially complete. For example, when you purchase a book from an online bookstore, you exchange money  for a book. If your credit is good, a series of related operations ensures that you get the book and the bookstore gets your money. However, if a single operation in the series fails during the exchange, the entire exchange fails. You do not get the book and the bookstore does not get your money. The technology responsible for making the exchange balanced and predictable is called transaction processing. Transactions ensure that data-oriented resources are not permanently updated unless all operations within the transactional unit complete successfully. By combining a set of related operations into a unit that either completely succeeds or completely fails, one can simplify error recovery and make one's application more reliable. Transaction processing systems consist of computer hardware and software hosting a transaction-oriented application that performs the routine transactions necessary to conduct business. Examples include systems that manage sales order entry, airline reservations, payroll, employee records, manufacturing, and shipping. Since most, though not necessarily all, transaction processing today is interactive the term is often treated as synonymous with online transaction processing.
DLS_format:DLS , is standardized file formats for digital musical instrument sound banks . The DLS standards also include detailed specifications for how MIDI protocol-controlled music synthesizers should render the instruments in a DLS file. As a result, some people consider DLS primarily a synthesizer specification and only secondarily a file format. The current DLS standards were developed first by the Interactive Audio Special Interest Group , and then by the MIDI Manufacturers Association . Any future versions of DLS would be developed through the MMA working group process. The DLS specifications are published in English by the MMA and in Japanese by Association of Musical Electronics Industry . The DLS family is closely related to the proprietary SoundFonts format from Creative Labs. All versions of DLS to date are based on sample-based synthesis, however in principle the DLS file format could be used to represent instrument definitions for other sound synthesis techniques. "DLS" is an acronym for "Downloadable Sounds", and also the initials of DLS 1 project leader Dave Sparks of Creative Labs. To date there have been three major versions of DLS:
*  DLS 1: Basic single-oscillator synthesizer voice, for PCs and PC sound cards
*  DLS 2: Adds per-voice lowpass filter + other enhancements
*  Mobile DLS: Reduced feature set and memory requirements, for mobile phones DLS is supported by the music synthesizers built into Windows and Mac OS X. Creative Labs sound cards for PCs support DLS. Numerous software music synthesizer products support DLS either natively or as an import format. DLS has been incorporated into other standards. The MMA's Extended RMID format encapsulates DLS 1 or DLS 2 files with a Standard MIDI File using the RIFF container technology. The MMA's XMF Type 0 and 1 formats encapsulate DLS 1 or DLS 2 files with Standard MIDI Files using the XMF container technology. The MMA's Mobile XMF format encapsulates zero or one Mobile DLS file and one Standard MIDI File using the XMF container technology. Mobile DLS is an optional media type in the 3GPP mobile phone standards starting from Release 6.
Danza_Kuduro:"Danza Kuduro" is a Spanish/Portuguese-language hit song from Don Omar's collaborative album Meet the Orphans released as the lead single from the album on August 15, 2010 through Machete Music and VI Music. It features singer Lucenzo, a French artist of Portuguese descent. "Danza Kuduro" was number one on the Hot Latin Songs, giving Don Omar his second US Billboard Hot Latin Songs number-one hit and Lucenzo his first. A remake of the song is also featured in the 2011 movie Fast Five as an ending song and is on the film's soundtrack album. Kuduro is a style of dancing and singing from Angola.
Friedman_translation:In mathematical logic, the Friedman translation is a certain transformation of intuitionistic formulas. Among other things it can be used to show that the Π02-theorems of various first-order theories of classical mathematics are also theorems of intuitionistic mathematics. It is named after its discoverer, Harvey Friedman.
Moskau_(song):"Moskau" is a German-language single by the German pop-act Dschinghis Khan  released in 1979. There was also an English-language version released in 1980 which was entitled "Moscow".
NeighborCity:NeighborCity is a residential real estate information and service company that rates real-estate agents in the United States, offering a way for buyers and sellers of homes to compare and evaluate agents. It is based in San Francisco. The company rates virtually every member of the National Association of Realtors in the United States, based on transaction and listing history. NeighborCity analyzes agents’ performance based on closing rate, number of closings, number of active listings, geographic specialization, number of days on market, rate of dual agency, sales price per square foot, and the difference between ask and sale price, for the homes they sell. NeighborCity provides an evaluation of the quality of service delivered by agents, with respect to their clients’ interests and relative to competing real-estate agents. The company also maintains a national database of real-estate listings. The site recommends corresponding independent buy-side real estate agents next to each for-sale listing along with a performance score and a link to a detailed professional profile for each recommended agent.
Polysyndactyly:Polysyndactyly is an hereditary anatomical malformation combining polydactyly and syndactyly.
Bitstream_Speedo_Fonts:Bitstream Speedo, or Speedo, are an obsolete scalable font format created by Bitstream Inc. Speedo was used on Atari ST, Falcon, in the XyWrite word processor, and in very early versions of WordPerfect and Microsoft Windows. Speedo was replaced by more popular font types like Type 1 fonts. Before Speedo was considered obsolete it was supported by the X Window System through the speedo module, and most Linux distributions had a Speedo font package, but support was removed from X in the X11R7.0 release in 2005. Speedo fonts have the file extension .spd.
Comparison_of_archive_formats:There are many popular computer data archive formats for creating and maintaining archive files. The tables below compare many popular archive formats.
Intergraph_Standard_File_Formats:Intergraph Standard File Formats  are the file formats common to MicroStation and Intergraph's Interactive Graphics Design System . ISFF is made available to the public, so that third-party developers could create applications for MicroStation that read and write ISFF format without a license from Intergraph.
* Design files, or DGN files  are binary files with variable-length records for graphic elements, and non-graphic data.
* Cell library files  are binary files that store cell definitions for placement in design files. MicroStation versions 8 and newer support the V8 DGN file format, but which has a different internal data structure than the ISFF-based DGN. In cases where there is potential for confusion, ISFF-based DGN may be called Intergraph DGN, or V7 DGN. Autodesk has chosen not to support DGN in AutoCAD 2006, although it does support the format in its Map3D, Land Desktop, and Civil3D products.
WebM:WebM is a video file format.It is primarily intended to offer a royalty-free alternative to use in the HTML5 video tag. It has a sister project WebP for images. The development of the format is sponsored by Google, and the corresponding software is distributed under a BSD license. The WebM container is based on a profile of Matroska. WebM initially supported VP8 video and Vorbis audio streams. In 2013 it was updated to accommodate VP9 video and Opus audio.
