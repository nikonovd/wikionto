JSON-LD: JSON-LD, or JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data, is a method of encoding Linked Data using JSON. It was a goal to require as little effort as possible from developers to transform their existing JSON to JSON-LD. This allows data to be serialized in a way that is similar to traditional JSON. It is a World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation. It was initially developed by the JSON for Linking Data Community Group before being transferred to the RDF Working Group for review, improvement, and standardization.
CLIPS: CLIPS is a public domain software tool for building expert systems. The name is an acronym for "C Language Integrated Production System." The syntax and name was inspired by Charles Forgy's OPS . The first versions of CLIPS were developed starting in 1985 at NASA-Johnson Space Center  until the mid-1990s when the development group's responsibilities ceased to focus on expert system technology. The original name of the project was NASA's AI Language . CLIPS is probably the most widely used expert system tool. CLIPS incorporates a complete object-oriented language  for writing expert systems. CLIPS itself is written in C, extensions can be written in C, and CLIPS can be called from C. Its user interface closely resembles that of the programming language Lisp. COOL combines the programming paradigms of procedural, object oriented and logical  languages. A language with a similar approach is Planner, which also combines traits of logical languages like Prolog with the capabilities of procedural and OO-languages like C++.
ECLiPSe: ECLiPSe is a software system for the development and deployment of Constraint Programming applications, e.g. in the areas of optimization, planning, scheduling, resource allocation, timetabling, transport etc.It is also suited for teaching most aspects of combinatorial problem solving, e.g.problem modeling, constraint programming, mathematical programming, and search techniques. It contains constraint solver libraries, a high-level modeling and control language , interfaces to third-party solvers, an integrated development environment and interfaces for embedding into host environments. ECLiPSe was developed until 1995 at the European Computer‐Industry Research Centre  in Munich and then until 2005 at the Centre for Planning and Resource Control at Imperial College London . It was purchased by Cisco Systems. In September 2006, it was released as open source software under an equivalent of the Mozilla Public License, and is now hosted on SourceForge.
M4_(computer_language): m4 is a general-purpose macro processor included in all UNIX-like operating systems, and is a component of the POSIX standard. The language was designed by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie for the original versions of UNIX. It is an extension of an earlier macro processor m3, written by Ritchie for the AP-3 minicomputer. The macro preprocessor operates as a text-replacement tool. It is employed to re-use text templates, typically in computer programming applications, but also in text editing and text-processing applications. Most users require m4 as a dependency of GNU autoconf.
PicoLisp: PicoLisp is an open source Lisp dialect. Itruns on Linux and other POSIX-compliant systems.
PostCSS: PostCSS is a software development tool that uses JavaScript-based plugins to automate routine CSS operations. The tool has been used to develop the code of Wikipedia, Facebook, and GitHub. PostCSS is a top-favored CSS tool among npm users. It was designed by Andrey Sitnik with the idea taking its origin in his front-end work for Evil Martians.
Ragel: Ragel is a finite-state machine compiler with output support for C, C++ and Assembly source code. It supports the generation of table or control flow driven state machines from regular expressions and/or state charts and can also build lexical analysers via the longest-match method. Ragel specifically targets text parsing and input validation.
Tcsh: tcsh  is a Unix shell based on and compatible with the C shell . It is essentially the C shell with programmable command-line completion, command-line editing, and a few other features. Unlike the other common shells, functions cannot be defined in a tcsh script and the user must use aliases instead .
Adobe_ColdFusion: Adobe ColdFusion is a commercial rapid web application development platform created by JJ Allaire in 1995.  ColdFusion was originally designed to make it easier to connect simple HTML pages to a database. By Version 2 , it became a full platform that included an IDE in addition to a full scripting language.
Apollo_Guidance_Computer: The Apollo Guidance Computer  was a digital computer produced for the Apollo program that was installed on board each Apollo Command Module  and Lunar Module . The AGC provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance, navigation, and control of the spacecraft. The AGC had a 16-bit word length, with 15 data bits and one parity bit. Most of the software on the AGC was stored in a special read only memory known as core rope memory, fashioned by weaving wires through magnetic cores, though a small amount of read-write core memory was provided. Astronauts communicated with the AGC using a numeric display and keyboard called the DSKY . The AGC and its DSKY user interface were developed in the early 1960s for the Apollo program by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory. The AGC is notable for being one of the first integrated circuit-based computers.
DIGITAL_Command_Language: DIGITAL Command Language  is the standard command languageadopted by most of the operating systems  that were sold by the former Digital Equipment Corporation . It had its roots in the IAS, TOPS-20, and RT-11 OSs and was implemented as a standard across most of Digital's OSs, notably RSX-11, but took its most powerful form in the OpenVMS OS. Written when the programming language Fortran was in heavy use, DCL is a scripting language supporting several datatypes, including strings, integers, bit arrays, arrays and booleans, but not floating point numbers. Access to OpenVMS system services  is through lexical functions, which perform the same as their compiled language counterparts and allow scripts to get information on system state. DCL includes IF-THEN-ELSE, access to all the Record Management Services  file types including stream, indexed, and sequential, but unfortunately lacks a DO-WHILE or other looping construct, requiring users to make do with IF and GOTO-label statements instead.
DTrace: DTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing framework created by Sun Microsystems for troubleshooting kernel and application problems on production systems in real time. Originally developed for Solaris, it has since been released under the free Common Development and Distribution License  and has been ported to several other Unix-like systems. DTrace can be used to get a global overview of a running system, such as the amount of memory, CPU time, filesystem and network resources used by the active processes. It can also provide much more fine-grained information, such as a log of the arguments with which a specific function is being called, or a list of the processes accessing a specific file. As of October 2011, Oracle announced the porting of DTrace from Solaris to Linux, but as of October 13, 2014 it remains officially unavailable. An unofficial DTrace port to Linux is available, although with no changes in licensing terms. As an alternative, Linux's SystemTap provides a similar set of features as DTrace.
General_Algebraic_Modeling_System: The General Algebraic Modeling System  is a high-level modeling system for mathematical optimization. GAMS is designed for modeling and solving linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization problems. The system is tailored for complex, large-scale modeling applications and allows the user to build large maintainable models that can be adapted to new situations. The system is available for use on various computer platforms. Models are portable from one platform to another. GAMS was the first algebraic modeling language  and is formally similar to commonly used fourth-generation programming languages. GAMS contains an integrated development environment  and is connected to a group of third-party optimization solvers. Among these solvers are BARON, COIN-OR solvers, CONOPT, CPLEX, DICOPT, Gurobi, MOSEK, SNOPT, SULUM, and XPRESS. GAMS allows the users to implement a sort of hybrid algorithm combining different solvers. Models are described in concise, human-readable algebraic statements. GAMS is among the most popular input formats for the NEOS Server. Although initially designed for applications related to economics and management science, it has a community of users from various backgrounds of engineering and science.
Isabelle_(proof_assistant): The Isabelle theorem prover is an interactive theorem prover, a Higher Order Logic  theorem prover. It is an LCF-style theorem prover , so it is based on a small logical core to ease logical correctness. Isabelle is generic: it provides a meta-logic , which is used to encode object logics like first-order logic , higher-order logic  or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory . Isabelle's main proof method is a higher-order version of resolution, based on higher-order unification. Though interactive, Isabelle also features efficient automatic reasoning tools, such as a term rewriting engine and a tableaux prover, as well as various decision procedures. Isabelle has been used to formalize numerous theorems from mathematics and computer science, like Gödel's completeness theorem, Gödel's theorem about the consistency of the axiom of choice, the prime number theorem, correctness of security protocols, and properties of programming language semantics. The Isabelle theorem prover is free software, released under the revised BSD license. Isabelle was named by Lawrence Paulson after Gérard Huet's daughter.
JavaServer_Pages: JavaServer Pages  is a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but it uses the Java programming language. To deploy and run JavaServer Pages, a compatible web server with a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, is required.
LLVM: The LLVM compiler infrastructure project  is a "collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies" used to develop compiler front ends and back ends. LLVM is written in C++ and is designed for compile-time, link-time, run-time, and "idle-time" optimization of programs written in arbitrary programming languages. Originally implemented for C and C++, the language-agnostic design of LLVM has since spawned a wide variety of front ends: languages with compilers that use LLVM include ActionScript, Ada, C#, Common Lisp, Crystal, D, Delphi, Fortran, OpenGL Shading Language, Halide, Haskell, Java bytecode, Julia, Lua, Objective-C, Pony, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, CUDA, Scala, and Swift. The LLVM project started in 2000 at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, under the direction of Vikram Adve and Chris Lattner. LLVM was originally developed as a research infrastructure to investigate dynamic compilation techniques for static and dynamic programming languages. LLVM was released under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, a permissive free software licence. In 2005, Apple Inc. hired Lattner and formed a team to work on the LLVM system for various uses within Apple's development systems. LLVM is an integral part of Apple's latest development tools for OS X and iOS. Since 2013, Sony has been using LLVM's primary front end Clang compiler in the software development kit  of its PS4 console. The name LLVM was originally an initialism for Low Level Virtual Machine, but this became increasingly less apt as LLVM became an "umbrella project" that included a variety of other compiler and low-level tool technologies, so the project abandoned the initialism. Now, LLVM is a brand that applies to the LLVM umbrella project, the LLVM intermediate representation , the LLVM debugger, the LLVM C++ Standard Library , etc. LLVM is administered by the LLVM Foundation. Its president is compiler engineer Tanya Lattner. The Association for Computing Machinery presented Adve, Lattner, and Evan Cheng with the 2012 ACM Software System Award for LLVM.
Lex_(software): Lex is a computer program that generates lexical analyzers . Lex is commonly used with the yacc parser generator. Lex, originally written by Mike Lesk and Eric Schmidt and described in 1975, is the standard lexical analyzer generator on many Unix systems, and an equivalent tool is specified as part of the POSIX standard. Lex reads an input stream specifying the lexical analyzer and outputs source code implementing the lexer in the C programming language.
MetaQuotes_Language_MQL4/MQL5: MQL4  and MQL5  are integrated programming languages designed for developing trading robots, technical market indicators, scripts and function libraries within the MetaTrader software. The primary objective of MQL4 and MQL5 is automation of trading and facilitation of operational analysis. MQL4 and MQL5 comprises an extensive codebase source code library used for developing trading robots.
MuPAD: MuPAD is a computer algebra system . Originally developed by the MuPAD research group at the University of Paderborn, Germany, development was taken over by the company SciFace Software GmbH & Co. KG in cooperation with the MuPAD research group and partners from some other universities starting in 1997. Until autumn 2005, the version "MuPAD Light" was offered for free for research and education, but as a result of the closure of the home institute of the MuPAD research group, only the version "MuPAD Pro" became available for purchase. The MuPAD kernel is bundled with Scientific Notebook and Scientific Workplace. Former versions of MuPAD Pro were bundled with SciLab. In MathCAD's version 14 release Mupad was adopted as the CAS engine. In September 2008, SciFace was purchased by MathWorks and the MuPAD code was included in the Symbolic Math Toolbox add-on for MATLAB. On 28 September 2008, MuPAD was withdrawn from the market as a software product in its own right. However, it is still available in the Symbolic Math Toolbox in MATLAB and can also be used as a stand-alone program.
PL/SQL: PL/SQL  is Oracle Corporation's procedural extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. PL/SQL is available in Oracle Database , TimesTen in-memory database , and IBM DB2 . Oracle Corporation usually extends PL/SQL functionality with each successive release of the Oracle Database. PL/SQL includes procedural language elements such as conditions and loops. It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variables of those types, and triggers. It can handle exceptions . Arrays are supported involving the use of PL/SQL collections. Implementations from version 8 of Oracle Database onwards have included features associated with object-orientation. One can create PL/SQL units such as procedures, functions, packages, types, and triggers, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications that use any of the Oracle Database programmatic interfaces.
Pickle_(Python): In the computer programming language Python, pickle is the standard mechanism for object serialization; pickling is the common term among Python programmers for serialization . Pickle uses a simple stack-based virtual machine that records the instructions used to reconstruct the object. This makes pickle vulnerable to security risks by malformed or maliciously constructed data, that may cause the deserializer to import arbitrary modules and instantiate any object. Not all object types can be pickled automatically, especially ones that hold operating system resources like file handles, but users can register custom "reduction" and construction functions to support the pickling and unpickling of arbitrary types. Pickle was originally implemented as the pure Python pickle module, but, in versions of Python prior to 3.0, the cPickle module  offers improved performance . The cPickle was adapted from the Unladen Swallow project. In Python 3, users should always import the standard version, which attempts to import the accelerated version and falls back to the pure Python version.
PowerBuilder: PowerBuilder is an integrated development environment owned by SAP. On July 5, 2016, SAP and Appeon entered into an agreement whereby Appeon would be responsible for developing, selling, and supporting PowerBuilder. PowerBuilder has been in use since 1991, peaking around 1998 with around 100,000 users.While PowerBuilder's market share has declined over the years, many applications created with it are still in use today. Over the years, PowerBuilder has been updated with new standards. In 2010, a major upgrade of PowerBuilder was released to provide support for the Microsoft .NET Framework. In 2014, support was added for OData, dockable windows, and 64-bit native applications. Sybase sold another programming tool called PocketBuilder. It was based on PowerBuilder and used for creating applications that run on mobile devices such as cell phones or PDAs. This product, however, has been discontinued — Sybase announced end of life in 2011 with support ending in 2012.
Regular_expression: In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular expression  is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching, i.e. "find and replace"-like operations. The concept arose in the 1950s, when the American mathematician Stephen Kleene formalized the description of a regular language, and came into common use with the Unix text processing utilities ed, an editor, and grep, a filter. In modern usage, "regular expressions" are often distinguished from the derived, but fundamentally distinct concepts of regex or regexp, which no longer describe a regular language. See  for details. Regexes are so useful in computing that the various systems to specify regexes have evolved to provide both a basic and extended standard for the grammar and syntax; modern regexes heavily augment the standard. Regex processors are found in several search engines, search and replace dialogs of several word processors and text editors, and in the command lines of text processing utilities, such as sed and AWK. Many programming languages provide regex capabilities, some built-in  and others via a standard library .Most other languages offer regexes via a library.
Sage_(Mozilla_Firefox_extension): Sage is a lightweight RSS and atom feed aggregator extension for the Mozilla Firefox web browser. The extension was developed by Peter Andrews and Erik Arvidsson under . Sage won the most "Most Innovative" award in Mozilla's 2006 "Extend Firefox" competition.
Stata: Stata is a general-purpose statistical software package created in 1985 by StataCorp. Most of its users work in research, especially in the fields of economics, sociology, political science, biomedicine and epidemiology. Stata's capabilities include data management, statistical analysis, graphics, simulations, regression, and custom programming. The name Stata is a syllabic abbreviation of the words statistics and data. The FAQ for the official forum of Stata insists that the correct English pronunciation of Stata "must remain a mystery"; any of "Stay-ta", "Sta-ta" or "Stah-ta" are considered acceptable. There are four major builds of each version of Stata:
*  Stata/MP for multiprocessor computers
*  Stata/SE for large databases
*  Stata/IC, which is the standard version
*  Small Stata, which is a smaller, student version for educational purchase only
Vim_script: No Summary
Wolfram_Mathematica: Wolfram Mathematica  is a symbolic mathematical computation program, sometimes called a computer algebra program, used in many scientific, engineering, mathematical, and computing fields. It was conceived by Stephen Wolfram and is developed by Wolfram Research of Champaign, Illinois. The Wolfram Language is the programming language used in Mathematica.
Xojo: The Xojo programming environment is developed and commercially marketed by Xojo, Inc of Austin, Texas for software development targeting Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, x86 Linux, iOS, as well as the web and Raspberry Pi. Xojo uses a proprietary object-oriented BASIC dialect, also known as Xojo.
Yacc: Yacc is a computer program for the Unix operating system. It is a Look Ahead Left-to-Right  parser generator, generating a parser, the part of a compiler that tries to make syntactic sense of the source code, specifically a LALR parser, based on an analytic grammar written in a notation similar to Backus–Naur Form . Yacc itself used to be available as the default parser generator on most Unix systems, though it has since been supplanted as the default by more recent, largely compatible, programs.
BitBake: BitBake is a make-like build tool with the special focus of distributions and packages for embedded Linux cross compilation although it is not limited to that. It is inspired by Portage, which is the package management system used by the Gentoo Linux distribution. BitBake existed for some time in the OpenEmbedded project until it was separated out into a standalone, maintained, distribution-independent tool. BitBake is co-maintained by the Yocto Project and the OpenEmbedded project. BitBake recipes specify how a particular package is built. It includes all the package dependencies, source code locations, configuration, compilation, build, install and remove instructions. It also stores the metadata for the package in standard variables. The BitBake recipes consist of the source URL  of the package, dependencies and compile or install options. During the build process they are used to track dependencies, performing native or cross-compilation of the package and package it so that it is suitable for installation on the local or a target device. It is also possible to create complete images consisting of a root file system and kernel. As a first step in a cross-build setup, the framework will attempt to create a cross-compiler toolchain suited for the target platform.
CMake: CMake is cross-platform free and open-source software for managing the build process of software using a compiler-independent method. It supports directory hierarchies and applications that depend on multiple libraries. It is used in conjunction with native build environments such as make, Apple's Xcode, and Microsoft Visual Studio. It has minimal dependencies, requiring only a C++ compiler on its own build system.
Easy_Java_Simulations: Old name ""EJS"" Easy Java Simulations or new name since 2014 EJSS, or Easy JavaScript Simulations, is an open-source software tool, part of the Open Source Physics project, designed for the creation of discrete computer simulations. A discrete computer simulation, or simply a computer simulation, is a computer program that tries to reproduce, for pedagogical or scientific purposes, a natural phenomenon through the visualization of the different states that it can have. Each of these states is described by a set of variables that change in time due to the iteration of a given algorithm. In creating a simulation with the help of EJSS, the user does not program the simulation at the level of writing code, instead the user is working at a higher conceptual level, declaring and organizing the equations and other mathematical expressions that operate the simulation. EJSS handles the technical aspects of coding the simulation in the Java programming language, thus freeing the user to concentrate on the simulation's content. The generated Java or JavaScript code can, in terms of efficiency and sophistication, be taken as the creation of a professional programmer. EJSS is written in the Java programming language and the created simulation are in Java or JavaScript. Java Virtual Machines  are available for many different platforms; a platform for which a JVM is available can run Java programs. Though Java applets were popular before 2014, JavaScript Applets outputs can be run on almost any device now, including Android and iOS. EJSS has its own format for storing the simulations, which is based on XML, EJS and EJSS and carries the extension .xml, .ejs and .ejss. It contains not only the code for the simulation, but also the rest of the things, like the html introduction.
FreeMarker: FreeMarker is a Java-based Template Engine, originally focusing on dynamic web page generation with MVC software architecture. However, it's a general purpose template engine, with no dependency on servlets or HTTP or HTML, and so it's often used for generating source code, configuration files or e-mails. FreeMarker is Free software.
GAP_(computer_algebra_system): GAP  is a computer algebra system for computational discrete algebra with particular emphasis on computational group theory.
Gnuplot: gnuplot is a command-line program that can generate two- and three-dimensional plots of functions, data, and data fits. It is frequently used for publication-quality graphics as well as education. The program runs on all major computers and operating systems . It is a program with a fairly long history, dating back to 1986. Despite its name, this software is not distributed under the GNU General Public License , but its own free software license.
Inno_Setup: Inno Setup is a free software script-driven installation system created in Delphi by Jordan Russell. The first version was released in 1997.
MediaWiki: MediaWiki is a free and open-source wiki application. Originally developed by Magnus Manske and improved by Lee Daniel Crocker, it runs on many websites, including Wikipedia, Wiktionary and Wikimedia Commons. It is written in the PHP programming language and stores the contents into a database. Like WordPress, which is based on a similar licensing & architecture, it has become the dominant software in its category. The first version of the software was deployed to serve the needs of the Wikipedia encyclopedia in 2002. Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects continue to define a large part of the requirement set for MediaWiki.The software is optimized to efficiently handle large projects, which can have terabytes of content and hundreds of thousands of hits per second. Because Wikipedia is one of the world's largest websites, achieving scalability through multiple layers of caching and database replication has been a major concern for developers. The software has more than 900 configuration settings and more than 2,200 extensions available for enabling various features to be added or changed. On Wikipedia alone, more than 1000 automated and semi-automated bots and other tools have been developed to assist in editing. It has also been deployed by some companies as an internal knowledge management system, and some educators have assigned students to use MediaWiki for collaborative group projects.
Nginx: Nginx  is software to provide a web server. It can act as a reverse proxy server for TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer and an HTTP cache. Created by Igor Sysoev in 2002, Nginx runs on Unix, Linux, BSD variants, OS X, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and Windows. Released under the terms of a BSD-like license, Nginx is free and open source software. A company of the same name was founded in 2011 to provide support.
Nim: Variants of Nim have been played since ancient times. The game is said to have originated in China—it closely resembles the Chinese game of "Tsyan-shizi", or "picking stones"—but the origin is uncertain; the earliest European references to Nim are from the beginning of the 16th century. Its current name was coined by Charles L. Bouton of Harvard University, who also developed the complete theory of the game in 1901, but the origins of the name were never fully explained. The name is probably derived from German nimm meaning "take [imperative]", or the obsolete English verb nim of the same meaning. Nim can be played as a misère game, in which the player to take the last object loses. Nim can also be played as a normal play game, which means that the person who makes the last move  wins. This is called normal play because most games follow this convention, even though Nim usually does not. Normal play Nim  is fundamental to the Sprague–Grundy theorem, which essentially says that in normal play every impartial game is equivalent to a Nim heap that yields the same outcome when played in parallel with other normal play impartial games . While all normal play impartial games can be assigned a Nim value, that is not the case under the misère convention. Only tame games can be played using the same strategy as misère nim. Nim is a special case of a poset game where the poset consists of disjoint chains . At the 1940 New York World's Fair Westinghouse displayed a machine, the Nimatron, that played Nim. It was also one of the first ever electronic computerized games. Ferranti built a Nim playing computer which was displayed at the Festival of Britain in 1951. In 1952 Herbert Koppel, Eugene Grant and Howard Bailer, engineers from the W. L. Maxon Corporation, developed a machine weighing 50 pounds which played Nim against a human opponent and regularly won. A Nim Playing Machine has been described made from TinkerToy. The game of Nim was the subject of Martin Gardner's February 1958 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. A version of Nim is played—and has symbolic importance—in the French New Wave film Last Year at Marienbad .
OpenSCAD: OpenSCAD is a free software application for creating solid 3D CAD objects. It is a script only based modeller, with a specific description language. Parts cannot be selected or modified by mouse in the 3D view.An OpenSCAD script specifies geometric primitives and defines how they are modified and manipulated to render a 3D model. OpenSCAD is available for Windows, Linux and OS X. It does constructive solid geometry . As of 2016, it uses Computational Geometry Algorithms Library  as the basic CSG engine, which along with other libraries takes care of details such as intersection, difference, envelope combination and Minkowski sums.
Papyrus_(software): Papyrus is an Open Source UML 2 tool  based on Eclipse and licensed under the EPL. It can either be used as a standalone tool or as an Eclipse plugin. Papyrus provides support for Domain Specific Languages and SysML.Papyrus is designed to be easily extensible.
Puppet_(software): In computing, Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows, and includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. Puppet is produced by Puppet Labs, founded by Luke Kanies in 2005. It is written in Ruby and released as free software under the GNU General Public License  until version 2.7.0 and the Apache License 2.0 after that.
Ren'Py: The Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine is a free software engine which facilitates the creation of visual novels, a form of computer-mediated storytelling. Ren'Py is a portmanteau of ren'ai , the Japanese word for 'love', a common element of games made using Ren'Py; and Python, the programming language that Ren'Py runs on. Ren'Py has proved attractive to English-language hobbyists; over 1000 games use the Ren'Py engine, nearly all in English.
Robot_Framework: The Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development . It is a keyword-driven testing framework that uses tabular test data syntax.
SQL_PL: SQL PL stands for Structured Query Language Procedural Language and was developed by IBM as a set of commands that extend the use of SQL in the IBM DB2  database system. It provides procedural programmability in addition to the querying commands of SQL. It is a subset of the SQL Persistent Stored Modules  language standard. As of DB2 version 9, SQL PL stored procedures can run natively inside the DB2 process  instead of being fenced in an external process. In DB2 version 9.7 IBM also added a PL/SQL front-end to this infrastructure , meaning that procedural SQL using either the ISO standard or Oracle's syntax compile to bytecode running on the same engine in DB2.
Salt_(software): SaltStack platform or Salt is a Python-based open-source configuration management software and remote execution engine. Supporting the "Infrastructure as Code" approach to deployment and cloud management, it competes primarily with Puppet, Chef, and Ansible.
